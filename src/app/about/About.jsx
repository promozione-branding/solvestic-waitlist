          <div className="mt-10 space-y-6 text-sm leading-[1.9] text-black sm:text-base">
            <p>
              As I stepped into a new chapter of my life, like any girl, I
              wanted to feel beautiful, confident, and comfortable in my own
              skin.
            </p>

            <p>
              I explored skincare with the same curiosity so many of us do —
              trying products, discovering brands, and trusting what seemed
              right.
            </p>

            <p>
              But one experience changed the way I looked at skincare entirely.
              What began as a simple attempt to care for my skin left me
              dealing with a skin concern I had never experienced before.
            </p>

            <p>
              I felt frustrated, overwhelmed, and, for a while, even hesitant
              to step outside.
            </p>

            <p>
              More than the skin concern itself, it made me question how easily
              we trust what we put on our skin — and how difficult it can be to
              know what is actually right for us.
            </p>

              <h2 className="font-serif text-4xl leading-[1.05] text-black sm:text-5xl">
                One simple question changed everything.
              </h2>

              <p className="mt-8 text-sm leading-[1.9] text-black sm:text-base">
                One day, during a conversation with my husband, he simply
                asked me,
              </p>

              <blockquote className="my-8 border-l border-[#AD51C1] pl-5 font-serif text-2xl leading-tight text-[#AD51C1] sm:text-3xl">
                “Instead of looking here and there, why don’t you formulate
                one yourself?”
              </blockquote>

              <p className="text-sm leading-[1.9] text-black sm:text-base">
                It was a simple question, but it stayed with us. Somewhere
                between long conversations and even longer nights, that
                question slowly became an idea — and eventually, a promise we
                made to each other, and to everyone who would one day trust us
                with their skin.

              That became the thought behind Solvestic.

              Solvestic was founded by Sneha Suman, a fashion designer, and
              Prince Verma, a model by profession — two people who came from
              creative worlds, but found themselves united by a deeply personal
              experience with skincare.

              Neither of us set out to build a skincare brand. But that

              determined to understand skincare differently.
